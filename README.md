# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program

### Step 2:
Assign values for the variables x2,x1,y2,y1.

### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)

### Step 4: 
Print the distance using format to display the answer with two decimal points.

### Step 5: 
End the program.

### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.

#RegisterNumber:23013374
import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

  


### OUTPUT:
